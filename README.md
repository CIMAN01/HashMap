# HashMap.java

Authors of building java programs have not included the source code for HashMap.java on their website, as promised in their textbook, for whatever reason(s). Only the source code for HashSet has been included. 

The HashMap.java code provided here closely mirrors the HashSet.java as to mimick the style of the authors. As such, the code here belongs to the authors of "Building Java Programs."
